# C-Prime

C-Prime is C without all the clutter. Inspired in part by CoffeeScript's
makeover of JavaScript, C-Prime believes that C can become more beautiful,
more readable, and easier to write. C-Prime is not a new language, however. It
is simply a more beautiful way of writing C code. C-Prime code then gets
directly transpiled to C code, to be compiled by your system's C compiler.

Basically, C-Prime doesn't get in the way of C grammar, but provides a less
cluttered (and in some cases less error-prone) way of writing it.

## The Road to 0.1

At this point, the Python script that currently acts as the transpiler is
basically finished, although more will probably be added to it as time goes on.
What's next? A new version of the C-Prime transpiler, written in C-Prime
(essentially a bootstrapped version).

The current sources for the bootstrapped transpiler can be found in `primec/`.

Additionally, thorough documentation of the language features will be essential
for C-Prime to have any hope of catching on.
